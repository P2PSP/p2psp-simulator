# DBS (Data Broadcasting Set) layer

# DBS is the most basic layer to provide communication among splitter
# (source of the stream) and peers (destination of the stream), using
# unicast transmissions. The splitter sends a different chunk of
# stream to each peer, using a random round-robin scheduler.

# TODO: In each round peers are selected at random, but all peers are
# sent a chunk, in a round).
